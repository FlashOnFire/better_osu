# better_osu
An attempt to recreate parts of the osu game in rust

I have started learning rust one week ago and wanted to do a big project in order to learn better.
That(s why I started this project which aims at creating a basic osu! in rust capable of reading and play beatmaps from the real game.

This project is here for educationnal purposes only, you won't be able to submit scores etc
